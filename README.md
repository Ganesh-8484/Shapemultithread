# Shapemultithread :- 

✨ Dynamically generated art: Every 2 seconds, the canvas refreshes with brand-new compositions—lines, circles, and colorful squares—making every run a visual surprise.

🚀 Smooth & responsive UI: Multithreaded architecture ensures the Start/Stop toggle works instantly, without freezing or lagging the interface.

🎛️ Control at your fingertips: One click starts a mesmerizing flow of generative shapes; another stops it cleanly with proper thread interruption.

🎨 Creative algorithms: Shapes are randomly positioned and colored using HSB and RGB color models to give the feel of digital abstract expressionism.

🔒 Thread-safe rendering: All canvas drawing is safely queued to the JavaFX Application Thread using Platform.runLater(), ensuring stability and performance.

💡 Built for visuals, not just code: The app’s polished layout, bordered controls, and fixed-size canvas provide a clean and focused creative experience.
